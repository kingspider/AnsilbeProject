# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access.

# If you need to provide access for other specific IPs or IP ranges, add them here:

# Note: Use of 'scram-sha-256' method requires SSL to be enabled on the server for secure password transmission
